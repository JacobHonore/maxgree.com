		  	<h1>It has been a long but a good journey</h1>It is now over four years ago since we started Maxgree by hosting our own Minecraft servers. To begin with the Minecraft servers that were supplied were not good enough for our needs and they were too difficult to command. With that in mind, we decided to give the players a better experience and host the servers on our own. We developed Maxgree control panel that could be controlled everywhere through your browser. This solution became popular very quickly and within a short period of time, 14 giant servers were up and running. Since then, Maxgree has been refined and our products have been maintained for people to enjoy.<br>Our goal was to serve a simple and fast solution that everybody could use no matter age. This aim led us to one of the most used server hosts in Europe and we have been lucky to have customers from all over the world. We put a lot of effort into this and we enjoyed all the great feedback we have received from our customers through the times. <br>But what have start often has an end and with these words Jacob and Steffen want to thank you many times for all your support. It has been an unforgettable journey.<br><br>As a reminder we recommend that you download your files, worlds and all the things you will like to save before the servers will be shut down. You will have this option until 31. December 2014.<br><br>Cheers<br>Jacob and Steffen<br>Founders of Maxgree</div>
